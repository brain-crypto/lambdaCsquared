# Î›c^2
This repo contains two programs and some discussions on how one can circumvent WeChat's (or in theory other Chinese social media's) censorship. The programs are designed to obscure Chinese characters so that they cannot be recognised by filters.

## Quickstart
### offline
1. Edit the settings on line 6-11 of offline/main.py<br>
2. Run offline/main.py<br>
Input: your text<br>
Output: offline/result.jpg<br>
### website
Open website/eng.html or website/cn.html in any browser or visit the [website](https://brain-crypto.github.io/lambdaCsquared/website/eng) hosted on Github pages.<br>

## Background
It is well-known that social media in China are heavily censored. Violators could find their messages deleted, accounts suspended, or even jailed. In light of recent events, the need for a quick way around internet censorship is even more pressing, as China cracks down on dissidents of its zero-covid policy, Russia blocks Facebook and Instagram over anti-war messages, and the Mahsa Amini protest still rages in Iran. This repo aims to address a small part of that problem - automatic chat filters on WeChat. 

### Text censorship
WeChat automatically scans messages and images for sensitive words. Previous research (Knockel et al 2018) has shown that this filter can be defeated by separating the characters, which is why both programs insert random characters between every two characters. They also set the inserted text and the original text to two different colors by default to improve readability for human. <br>
Nonetheless, it is safe to assume that WeChat will eventually improve its filter, which is why offline/main.py draws random lines over every character and randomly varies each character's position. The basic idea here is to prevent the filter from recongising the individual characters. Tests with several online Chinese OCD software have shown that this reduces the recognition rate significantly. <br>
One can reduce the recognition rate even further by overlapping the characters. However, we do not recommend this method as it also reduces the text's readability for humans, although you can add this functionality by replacing the two `space += fontsize` in main.py line 32 and 39 with `space += fontsize *0.6` 

### Image censorship
WeChat compares images to a list of blocked images and blocks those that are too similar. In anticipation that the characters on a blank paper format might be blocked, we added an option to add a random stock image background for our website. <br>
This repo cannot help you send sensitive images. For that, we recommend covering your image with a lot of markups, or if you want to be extra fancy, run a [neural style transfer model](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization).

## Limitations 
1. It is inevitable that once a message or image gains enough popularity, it will be subjected to manual review, which cannot be countered. 
2. The same program can be used to circumvent other social media filters on conspiracy theories and hate speeches, which we strongly condemn. However, we believe that the benefits of free speech under oppressive regimes significantly outweigh these harms.

We cannot guarantee that these programs will always work, nor be held liable for any damages that ensue or for the content posted using these programs. This project received no funding and has no conflict of interest.
